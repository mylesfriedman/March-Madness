Using Deep Learning to Predict the 2023 NCAA Tournament

I attempt to use deep learning networks to predict the outcome of the men's college baskebtall NCAA tournament, more popularly refered to as March MAdness. I utilize the KenPom rankings (https://kenpom.com/) of each team the year they played, and combine that with the outcomes of each NCAA tournament game from 2002 to 2021. I test my model on the 2022 NCAA tournamnet to see how I would've performed versus the general public in ESPNs annual March Madness bracket tournament. I then use my model to make my predictions for this year's tournament.
